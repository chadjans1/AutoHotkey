# AutoHotkey
I have started to learn AutoHotkey scripting which started with picking up a very lightly used DeLUX brand T9 Single Handed Keyboard. This keyboard is typically used for computer gaming but it is great for my macro keyboard use case. Current live link: https://www.kkmoon.com/p-c3545.html

Starting with Taran's "DIY 87 macro keyboard: The sequel -- Intercept.exe and [TEN] EXTRA KEYBOARDS" found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3e_ri-vOIo and his code samples found here: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard, I created my neccessary AutoHotkey script and Intercept INI file. 

Thank you Taran for your work, it was invaluable for my understanding of AutoHotkey and Macro creation. 

Here was my step by step:
1. Purchase DeLUX T9 from an eBay listing.
2. Plug-in DeLUX T9 keyboard into a Windows machine and using Windows "Device Manager" find the DeLUX T9 device listing and identify the 
Vendor ID and Hardware ID. You will need these for your Intercept INI file.

Change Log
1. Added working README.md, 002 and 003
2. For 002, added back in AutoHotkey keep window on top routine. Was finding the Microsoft PowerToys "Window Stay On Top" tool was not always working correctly. Remarked out the code and will reconsider the tool with a later release of Windows PowerToys.
