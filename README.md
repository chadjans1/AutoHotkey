# AutoHotkey
I have started to learn AutoHotkey scripting which started with picking up a very lightly used DeLUX brand T9 Single Handed Keyboard. This keyboard is typically used for computer gaming but it is great for my macro keyboard use case.

Starting with Taran's "DIY 87 macro keyboard: The sequel -- Intercept.exe and [TEN] EXTRA KEYBOARDS" found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3e_ri-vOIo and his code samples found here: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard, I created my neccessary AutoHotkey script and Intercept INI file.
