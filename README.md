# AutoHotkey
I have started to learn AutoHotkey scripting which started with picking up a very lightly used DeLUX brand T9 Single Handed Keyboard. This keyboard is typically used for computer gaming but it is great for my macro keyboard use case. 

Starting with Taran's "DIY 87 macro keyboard: The sequel -- Intercept.exe and [TEN] EXTRA KEYBOARDS" found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3e_ri-vOIo and his code samples found here: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard, I created my neccessary AutoHotkey script and Intercept INI files. 

Thank you Taran for your work, it was invaluable for my understanding of AutoHotkey and Macro creation. 

Here was my step by step:
1. Find and purchase DeLUX T9 keyboard. Current manufacture link: https://www.kkmoon.com/p-c3545.html.
2. Plug-in DeLUX T9 keyboard into a Windows machine and using Windows "Device Manager" find the DeLUX T9 device listing and identify the 
Vendor ID and Hardware ID. You will need these for your Intercept INI file. In case you are currious about Vendor and Hardware IDs, here is a lookup tool and database: https://devicehunt.com/.

Change Log
1. Added working "README.md", "002a keyremap.ini" and "003a DeLUX T9 Macros.ahk".
2. For "003a", added back in AutoHotkey keep window on top routine. Was finding the Microsoft PowerToys "Window Stay On Top" tool was not always working correctly. Remarked out the code and will reconsider the tool with a later release of Windows PowerToys.
